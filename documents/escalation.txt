Escalation Guidelines:

1. When to Escalate:
   - When classification is ambiguous (e.g., unclear email purpose).
   - When an automated response could cause reputational risk.
   - When the sender is a VIP or an external legal entity.

2. Admin Handling:
   - Review full email content and logs.
   - Provide manual response or adjust classification logic.
   - Option to retrain model or update flow state.

3. Logging:
   - All escalations are logged to /logs/escalations.
   - Admin response is tracked for learning.
